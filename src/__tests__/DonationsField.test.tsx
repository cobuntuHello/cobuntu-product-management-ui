/**
 * Donations on the create-wizard pricing step.
 *
 * The redesign this pins: the switch lives on the ROW, and the modal opens
 * only once there is something in it.
 *
 * Before, the row was a pure drill-in and the switch lived inside the dialog.
 * `DonationsSection` is a header plus `<Collapse open={enabled}>`, so with
 * donations off there was nothing to collapse open and the modal was one
 * switch with two different ways to close it. Every complaint about that
 * dialog followed from it being empty: the dead space, the ✕-plus-Close pair,
 * the right-aligned Close sitting where a primary action goes.
 *
 * It was also the odd one out on its own step, where "Require approval" and
 * "Can be bought more than once" are inline toggle rows.
