/**
 * Every portalled popover must sit ABOVE the modal that opens it.
 *
 * ModalShell (@cobuntu/management-ui-shared) moved from z-50 to z-[120] on
 * 2026-08-08 so its backdrop would cover the community app's sidebar. The
 * popovers in THIS package were left behind at z-50 and z-[80], so the currency
 * dropdown and every ⓘ tooltip in the tier modal stopped appearing — they were
 * rendering, just underneath. Reported 2026-08-09 as "the dropdown doesn't open
 * anything" and "the ? tooltip doesn't show anything".
 *
 * Nothing connected the two numbers, and neither file could see the other. This
 * asserts the relationship directly, by reading the source, so raising one
 * without the other fails here instead of in someone's browser.
 *
 * Deliberately a >= comparison rather than exact values: the point is the
 * ORDERING, and pinning literals would just move the silent breakage to
 * whoever next needs a different number.
