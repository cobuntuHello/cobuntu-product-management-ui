/**
 * Step identity and copy for the tier modal's Level-3 screens.

 * These lived in TierHubView.tsx, alongside a component nothing rendered. The
 * component was the pre-redesign tile menu, replaced by TierEditView; only its
 * constants were still imported, so the file survived purely as their home
 * while carrying a stale `disabled={!t.id}` gate on its Registration form
 * tile — the very gate that had to be fixed in the live view when forms became
 * reachable on unsaved tiers. Keeping dead UI around with an out-of-date rule
 * in it is how that rule gets copied back in by someone re-wiring it.
