/**
 * Donations on the create-wizard pricing step: a row that owns its own switch,
 * and drills into the settings modal ONLY once it is on.
 *
 * ── Why the switch is on the row ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to be a pure drill-in: the whole row opened a modal, and the switch
 * lived inside it. That made the dialog EMPTY in its most common state.
 * `DonationsSection` is a header plus `<Collapse open={enabled}>`, so with
 * donations off there is nothing to collapse open and the modal was one switch
 * and two different ways to close it. Everything that read as wrong about it
 * followed from that: the dead space, the ✕-plus-Close pair, the right-aligned
 * Close sitting where a primary action goes.
 *
 * It was also the odd one out on its own step. "Require approval" and "Can be
 * bought more than once" sit beside it as inline toggle rows; only Donations
 * made you open a dialog to flip a switch.
 *
 * So: switch on the row (one tap, same as its neighbours), and the chevron
 * appears only when it leads somewhere. A chevron promises a destination; it
 * should not promise a dialog containing the control you just walked past.
 *
 * Donations remain listing-level, not per-tier — that is why this sits OUTSIDE
 * the variants card and why one prompt covers every variant. The settings
 * themselves (mode, amounts, minimum, label) are real config and still earn a
 * modal, once there is something to configure.
 *
 * `DonationsSection` is unchanged and keeps its `Collapse`: on the manage page
 * it renders inside a tier card in `PriceEditModal`, where revealing inline is
 * the right behaviour. Only this wizard chrome changes. Because the section
 * still renders its own header + switch, it is asked to hide them here
 * (`hideHeader`) so the modal does not repeat the row you opened it from.
