/**
 * Re-export of `ModalShell` from `@cobuntu/management-ui-shared`.
 *
 * The shared primitive is API-compatible with the previous local
 * component — it accepts the same `children` / `onClose` / `width`
 * props. The shared version additionally exposes `title`, `subtitle`,
 * `headerExtra`, `footer`, `dismissOnBackdrop`, and a fixed max-height
 * with internal scroll. Existing call-sites that don't pass title or
 * footer collapse to body-only, matching prior behavior.
 *
 * The shared shell renders a default close button in its header — we
 * force `hideCloseButton: true` here so call-sites that bring their
 * own close affordance inside `children` don't double up. Components
 * adopting the new slot-based layout can pass `hideCloseButton={false}`
 * (or the new shell from "@cobuntu/management-ui-shared" directly) once
 * they're refactored.
