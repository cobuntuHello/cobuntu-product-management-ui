 * Why the cap exists: `products.name` is unbounded Postgres `text`, and a
 * seller pasted an entire Instagram caption into it on a live community -- 1399
 * characters, emoji and trailing URL included. It rendered as an <h1> and
 * pushed the price and buy buttons below the fold.

 * Why 100: the event rename modal and edit drawer already capped names at 100.
 * Creation simply never honoured it.
